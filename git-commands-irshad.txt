=== GIT LEARNING FOR FUTURE USE ===

*IMP*
Creating the access token is very much required, after 2021, github changed the authentication, to create a access token:
Follow the below steps:

1) Right click on the profile, select on the profile settings and at the left last side click on developer settinsg
2) Create a access token and then use that as password of your account


One observation: 


1) We have our code deployed in the prod branch and u are working on the prod branch itself but lets say some person changes the values, so now ur local has 2 changes in the same file and the remote has the same change, then when u do a git pull u will get the below error:

Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result

So, for this to happen, push your code to a new prod-new branch and raise a merge request to prod, resolve the conflicts and then create a merge request to prod, and all your code will be now available in the prod branch and when u do a git pull, it will fetch properly and tell us the status

==========  GIT DOCUMENTATION ===============
 
-> ROM LOCAL SYSTEM TO GIT ( ROLE : OWNER )

1) CLONING INTO LOCAL ( EVEN IF YOU ARE DEVELOPER/OWNER ) CLONING WILL BE DONE.
   command: git clone https://oauth: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@github.com/Irshu786/devops-cmu-project.git
   
A) If you want to Clone a Branch
   git clone  --branch prod https://oauth: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@github.com/Irshu786/devops-cmu-project.git

2) PULLING THE REPO ( EVEN IF YOU ARE DEVELOPER/OWNER ) PULLING WILL BE DONE
NOTE: Before pulling the Repo, first git initialize into folder
   command: git init
   command: git clone https://oauth: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@github.com/Irshu786/devops-cmu-project.git
   
A) Pulling the Repo from a specific branch
   command: git pull https://oauth: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@github.com/Irshu786/devops-cmu-project.git prod


== PUSHING STARTS FROM HERE ==

3) PUSHING INTO GIT ( MASTER )

A. IF YOU ARE OWNER 
===================
 
If we directly push into master, cmd: git push -u origin master
Error: fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository, fatal: Could not read from remote repository.Please make sure you have the correct access rights, and the repository exists.

CASE-A: You have changed the file/files, then pushing into git

1) git init
2) git pull https://oauth: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@github.com/Irshu786/devops-cmu-project.git
3) git add .
4) git commit -m "adding files/changing some files" 
5) git remote add origin https://oauth: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@github.com/Irshu786/devops-cmu-project.git
6) git push -u origin master

CASE-B: You havent changed the file/files, then pushing into git

( As you do the steps from 1 TO 6 above, everything will work fine and the commit added here will not be shown in git )
RESPONSE: Branch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.Everything up-to-date



4) PUSHING INTO GIT ( BRANCH )

If we directly push into branch also, cmd: git push -u origin branch
Error: fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository, fatal: Could not read from remote repository.Please make sure you have the correct access rights, and the repository exists.

1) git init
2) git pull https://oauth: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@github.com/Irshu786/devops-cmu-project.git
3) git add .
4) git commit -m "some_text" 
5) git remote add origin https://oauth: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@github.com/Irshu786/devops-cmu-project.git
[ Push we can do it directly having current branch or we can create by (git checkout -b <branch_name>) ]
6) git push -u origin <branch_name> 





B. IF YOU ARE DEVELOPER 
=======================


I) We cant directly push into master, if we are developer, for that we have create a merge request, as by creating a brach in that folder. 
A) Create a merge request:
[ This is a good method to add a new branch and ask for merge request ]
1) git init
2) git pull https://oauth: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@github.com/Irshu786/devops-cmu-project.git
3) Change anything
4) git add .
5) git commit -m "Text Anything"
6) git remote add origin https://oauth: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@github.com/Irshu786/devops-cmu-project.git
7) git checkout -b <branch_name>
8) git push origin <branch_name>
9) Go to Gitlab UI, Go to the branch which we have given and click on create merge request, after then fill all the details as shown below. 
10) Maintainer, Owner will check the code and merge the branch into the master. 


II) Pulling and pushing into the branch

1) git init
2) git pull https://oauth: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@github.com/Irshu786/devops-cmu-project.git dev-1 
3) Change anything
4) git add .
5) git commit -m "Text Anything"
6) git remote add origin https://oauth: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@github.com/Irshu786/devops-cmu-project.git
7) git checkout -b <branch_name>
8) git push origin <branch_name>

Even after merge conflicts are resolved, if u cant go to the main branch, use force and then pull again

git checkout main --force

#git clone https://oauth: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@github.com/Irshu786/devops-cmu-project.git
